# JavaExamples

This section contains a basic Java project that makes use of the sample REST project included with ISIM.

As this sample makes use of Wink/JAX-RS the **com.ibm.jaxrs.thinclient_8.5.0.jar** (from WebSphere) should be 
included in your classpath.

The program takes input from std in.

`BASE_URL` in **rest.example.Constants** should be udpated with your ISIM URL </br>
`(example: http://isimserver:9080/itim )`
