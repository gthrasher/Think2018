# cURL Examples
Each subfolder contains cURL examples for the same sort of activities across **ISIM, PIM and IGI**:

* **Authentication**
* **Search for a User**

Each product's REST APIs handle requests differently, and showing Authentication and a simple Search across all
is a good example of the differences across the products.

Each folder contains a single text file...the different commands are labeled to indicate what is being done.
Each command should be run in sequence, via cURL (command line).  

**NOTE: the examples are formatted for Linux...if so may need to be modified for other platforms.**

**NOTE: The code/documentation found here is NOT supported, and is supplied only as examples/reference.
Use at your own risk** :metal:
